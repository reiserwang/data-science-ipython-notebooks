# Deep Learning Frameworks

## 1. TensorFlow
* Low-level core (C++/CUDA)
* Simple Python API to define he computational graph
* High-level API's (TF-Learn, TF-Slim, Keras)
* (+)  Auto differentiation - easy multi-GPU/multi-node
* (+) Active on Github. Lot's of new APIs

## 2. Theano
## 3. Keras
* (+) Easy-to-use Python library that wraps Theano and Tensorflow.
* (+) Libraries, tools and Google official support
* (-) Less flexible and less projects (as of current than caffe).
* (-) Multi-GPU not working 100%
* (-) No RBM

## 4. Torch
## 5. Caffe
* Applications in machine learning, vision, speech, and multimedia.
* Good for feed-forward networks and image processing.
* Widely acceptable from research communities.
* Good Python and MATLAB interfaces
* Excellent ConvNet implementation
* (-) Not intended for applications such as text, sound, or time series data
* (-) No auto-differentiation
* Not good for RNN, mainly CNN
* (-) Cubersome for big networks (GooLeNet, ResNet)

## Conclusions
* You're a PhD student on DL --> **TensorFlow**, **Theano**, **Torch**
* You awant to use DL only to get deatures --> **Keras**, **Caffe**
* You work in industry --> **TensorFlow**, **Caffe**
* You want to give pracrice works to your students --> **Keras**, **Caffe**
* You're curuous about deep learning --> **Caffe**
* You don't even know python --> **Keras**, **Torch**

## Applications
* **Computer Vision** - distill information from images ot video, face recognition, content moderator, emotion detection, etc.
